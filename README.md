# Directionality-Aware Mixture Model Parallel Sampling for Efficient Dynamical System Learning

Barebone implementation of Directionality-Aware Mixture Model(DAMM) designed for the learning of Linear Parameter Varying Dynamical System (LPV-DS). This module has been integrated as a part of the [LPV-DS](https://github.com/SunannnSun/lpvds) framework. Please refer to the [LPV-DS](https://github.com/SunannnSun/lpvds) repository for the specific use.
